All-natural with no need for medication, safe with no UV and no side effects, fast and easy with quick flash-and-go sequences, and it heals inflammation so skin looks and feels better immediately.</p>

            <h3>NASA-Pioneered Healing</h3>
            <p>Pioneered by NASA and now accepted as a natural, non-invasive way to treat acne, anti-aging, and pain management. The application of biophotonic light therapy encourages natural cellular activity through light-emitting diodes applied to the skin's surface.</p>
            <p>LLLT normalizes cellular function, providing relief from inflammation. Celluma triggers a cascade of metabolic processes which restores compromised cellular function, creating a path to revitalized, clear skin. Blue light kills acne bacteria while red light reduces inflammation and promotes healing.</p>
